    - When you click a dataset (such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"), you will be given a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization. The following image is a sampling of earthquake data in JSON format:   
    
    - Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

      - Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

    - Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

    - Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
